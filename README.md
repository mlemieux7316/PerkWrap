# PerkWrap
v1.1 Update: Flagged .esp as .esl; the mod is tiny and simple!

This is a "my first mod" kind of mod, but I hope someone finds it useful!

This is a simple Skyrim mod that edits the vanilla perk tree to allow you to invest in perks near any other perk you have already invested in (ie. "wrap around" capability).

This mod edits only the perks from the vanilla perk tree that are part of a loop, adding an "OR" condition for the other adjacent perk. Therefore, it should not break anything or cause any issues with your game if you are using the vanilla perk tree.

This mod is not (yet) compatible with any mod that alters the vanilla perk tree in any way. I will consider making a patch for other popular perk overhauls like Ordinator if this mod gains any traction at all, but this was mainly a thing I wanted in my game, couldn't find it anywhere, so I learned a bit about Skyrim modding to create it, and now I'd like to share it.

This is my first mod, and the first (technically second) public release of that mod, so any critiques are appreciated.

Should work for LE as well, if formIDs don't present a problem..
